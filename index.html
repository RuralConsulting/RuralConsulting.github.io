                        Farming in New Zealand has seldom faced as many challenges as it does today – With our expertise

What began as an initial visit to create a Farm Environment Plan (FEP) evolved into a range of initiatives designed to build financial and environmental resilience.

                                    Through our long-term partnership with the Armstrong family, we developed a deep understanding of their farm operations, goals, and potential opportunities. This allowed us to quickly and efficiently identify funding streams, improve resource management practices, and secure ETS registration. Our comprehensive approach ensured that the Armstrongs maximised the financial and environmental opportunities available, while continuing to enhance the sustainability of their farm.

                                    The Hurunui District Landcare Group (HDLG) is a farmer-led, farmer-driven catchment group established in 2016 to promote good farming practices and support farmers in understanding their environmental footprint. With 320 member farms collectively managing over 320,000 hectares in North Canterbury, the group takes a proactive, collaborative approach to protecting and enhancing natural and physical resources in the region.

                                <p>
                                    Rural Consulting began working with the HDLG in early 2017, initially providing facilitation and group coordination services. Over time, we’ve built a strong partnership with the group and its members, working closely with the HDLG committee—comprised of full-time farmers who volunteer their time—to bring their vision to life through impactful projects and initiatives.

The resulting report gave decision-makers the confidence to permit dryland farming in 2020.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Farm Environment Plans (FEPs):</strong> Worked with HDLG members to review and develop over 300 FEPs.

                                    In 2019, Rural Consulting was engaged by Environment Canterbury (ECan) to assist with their application for the Hill Country Erosion Funding from Central Government. This represented a significant opportunity for both the council and rural communities impacted by hill country erosion, as there had not been a formal erosion mitigation programme in Canterbury since the days of Catchment Boards.
                                </p>
                                <h5>Our Approach</h5>
                                <p>
                                    With a deep understanding of the regional council’s requirements and the unique challenges faced by the rural community, Rural Consulting designed a programme that balanced the needs of both, ensuring its success for all stakeholders. Our contributions included:
                                </p>
                                <div class="bullets-container">

                                            <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Led outreach to the rural community on behalf of ECan, ensuring the proposed programme reflected the needs and realities of farmers in the region.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Project Development:</strong> Collaborated with ECan to develop a robust project outline that addressed both environmental goals and practical considerations for implementation.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Funding Application:</strong> Assisted with the preparation and writing of a successful funding application for the Hill Country Erosion Programme.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <h5>Outcome</h5>
                                <p>
                                    The funding application was successful, enabling ECan to deliver the Soil Conservation and Revegation Programme (SCAR). The programme has since become a cornerstone of erosion mitigation efforts in Canterbury, benefiting both the environment and the farming community. In 2022, ECan invited Rural Consulting to assist with a reapplication to the Hill Country Erosion Programme, further strengthening the initiative’s impact.

                                <p>
                                    Central to the programme’s success has been Rural Consulting’s ability to balance the priorities of the regional council with the practical needs of farmers. Our relationships, coupled with our understanding of both stakeholders, have ensured the programme is not only well-received but also highly effective.

                                    The Black Maps, created in the mid-19th century, offer a unique and highly detailed record of New Zealand’s pre-European environment. Over the past seven years, Rural Consulting Limited has collaborated with Environment Canterbury and Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu to transform these historical artifacts into a powerful digital resource.

                                    Using a robust digitisation methodology and georeferencing techniques, we have structured the maps for integration into Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This has made the maps accessible for spatial analysis, cultural heritage research, and ecological restoration projects.

The consent process can be fraught, and we anticipated potential challenges due to the presence of wetlands on their property. With growing scrutiny around water take consents in Canterbury, it was critical to address these concerns proactively and demonstrate compliance with both regulatory requirements and environmental best practices.

                                    The consent was granted quickly and at minimal cost, standing out as an example of an efficient and effective application process. This result was achieved despite a broader climate in Canterbury where resource consents were often delayed and costly.

                                    Rural Consulting Limited was engaged to review and assess the Land Use Capability (LUC) mapping for a proposed subdivision consent application. The national dataset, New Zealand Land Resource Inventory (NZLRI), had classified part of the site as LUC 3, triggering the National Policy Statement for Highly Productive Land (NPS-HPL). This designation posed a significant challenge to the applicant’s consent process, requiring additional assessments and policy compliance.
                                </p>
                                <h5>Our Approach</h5>
                                <p>We undertook a comprehensive review of the NZLRI mapping and conducted detailed, site-specific LUC mapping. Key steps included:</p>

                                    <div class="bullets">
                                        <ul class="left-list">
                                            <li><strong>Desktop Analysis:</strong> Examined existing data, including the NZLRI, Manaaki Whenua S-Map, historical Black Maps, and a high-resolution 1m Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</li>
                                            <li><strong>Field Survey:</strong> Conducted soil profile evaluations using site auger sampling, documenting 11 key locations.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Detailed Mapping:</strong> Reassessed LUC classifications at a scale of 1:12,500 to improve accuracy compared to the national dataset's 1:50,000 scale.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <h5>Key Findings</h5>
                                <p>Our site-specific mapping identified that while the general area’s classification in the NZLRI was broadly accurate, the delineation of the LUC 3 class was incorrect:</p>
                                <div class="bullets-container">
                                    <div class="bullets">
                                        <ul class="left-list">
                                            <li>Reclassification: The area previously identified as LUC 3 was found to consist of sandy soils more appropriately classified as LUC 4, which is not considered highly productive under the NPS-HPL.</li>
                                            <li>Boundary Adjustment: We revised the boundary between LUC 3 and LUC 4, confirming the proposed subdivision area does not fall within the highly productive land designation</li>
                                        </ul>

                                <p>
                                    The revised mapping allowed the applicant to demonstrate that the NPS-HPL did not apply to their subdivision consent application. This avoided the need for additional work, such as productivity assessments, and simplified the consent process.
                                </p>
